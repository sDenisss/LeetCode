# 🧩 LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains some of my solutions to **LeetCode** problems.  
⚠️ Not all of them are the most optimal — sometimes I focus on readability, learning, or just getting an accepted answer first.

## 📌 About
- 🚀 Language: **C#**(mostly) and **Java**.  
- 📚 Problems are organized by number and difficulty (Easy(mostly) / Medium / Hard).  
- 🛠️ Main goal: **learning and improving problem-solving skills**, not just collecting green checkmarks.  

---

## ✅ Notes
- Some solutions might be brute-force at first.  
- I plan to refactor and optimize over time.  
- Feel free to suggest improvements or alternative approaches via issues or pull requests.
